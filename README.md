# GrassBoundary
This code detects grass using feature extraction, with color as the extracted feature.

The goal of this project is to integrate it with a use of a camera, mounted with a mini PC that has a com port connected to a GPS module.
The image processing is done using AForge.net NuGet Package, and some other packages will also be required to write the values obtained from image processing into xlsx files.
Such packages are like emgu, for example.
